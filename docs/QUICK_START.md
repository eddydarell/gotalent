# GoTalent Platform Unification - Quick Start Guide

## 🎉 What's Been Accomplished

Your GoTalent platform has been successfully unified into a modern microservices architecture! Here's what we've done:

### ✅ Completed Changes

1. **Renamed all services** for clarity:
   - `host_app` → `scanner` (QR code scanner)
   - `participant_app` → `badge` (Badge generator)
   - `inscription_form` → `form` (Registration form)

2. **Created unified database** (`data/gotalent.db`):
   - Single SQLite database for all services
   - Merged schemas from old databases
   - Migration script included
   - Mounted on host for easy backup

3. **Migrated to Bun runtime**:
   - Scanner service ✅
   - Badge service ✅  
   - Form service ⏳ (90% complete)

4. **Setup Docker orchestration**:
   - `compose.yml` with all services
   - Caddy reverse proxy
   - Adminer for database management
   - Health checks and auto-restart

5. **Extracted design system**:
   - Centralized design tokens
   - Color palette, typography, spacing
   - Ready to apply across all services

6. **Created comprehensive documentation**:
   - Main README with full setup guide
   - Migration plan and summary
   - Service-specific READMEs

## 🚀 How to Use

### Quick Start (Recommended)

```bash
# Navigate to project
cd /Users/eddyntambwe/Dev/gotalent

# Initialize database (run once)
bun run migrate-db.js

# Start all services
docker-compose up --build
```

### Access Services

Once running, access services at:

- **Landing Page**: http://localhost (or http://localhost:3001)
- **Registration Form**: http://localhost/form (or http://localhost:3002)
- **Badge Generator**: http://localhost/badge (or http://localhost:3003)
- **QR Scanner**: http://localhost/scanner (or http://localhost:3004)
- **Database Admin**: http://localhost/db (or http://localhost:8080)

### Development Mode

Run services individually for development:

```bash
# Scanner
cd scanner
bun install
bun run dev:full

# Badge
cd badge
bun install
bun run dev:full

# Form
cd form
bun install
bun run dev  # Frontend only for now

# Landing
cd landing
python3 -m http.server 3001
```

Legend: 🆕 = New | ✏️ = Modified | ⏳ = In Progress

## 🔧 Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `compose.yml` | Orchestrates all services in Docker |
| `Caddyfile` | Routes requests to correct service |
| `migrate-db.js` | Migrates old databases to new unified one |
| `design-tokens.js` | Centralized design system tokens |
| `data/gotalent.db` | Shared SQLite database |
| `data/init-db.sql` | Database schema definition |

## 🎨 Design System

All services now share a unified design:

**Colors**: Gold (`#daa520`) on dark (`#1c1c1c`) with cream text (`#f3e5ab`)  
**Fonts**: Inter for UI, JetBrains Mono for code  
**Style**: Mining/industrial theme with professional aesthetics

Apply to your services using `design-tokens.js`.

## 📊 Service Ports

| Service | Direct Port | Proxy Path |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| Landing | 3001 | `/` |
| Form | 3002 | `/form` |
| Badge | 3003 | `/badge` |
| Scanner | 3004 | `/scanner` |
| Adminer | 8080 | `/db` |
| Caddy | 80/443 | - |

## 🔄 Next Steps

### Must Do (Before Production)

1. **Complete Form Migration**:
   ```bash
   cd form/server
   # Convert server.ts to Bun
   # Update Dockerfile
   ```

2. **Run Migration**:
   ```bash
   bun run migrate-db.js
   # Verify all data migrated correctly
   ```

3. **Test Integration**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   # Test all services
   # Verify database sharing
   ```

### Should Do (For Consistency)

4. **Apply Design System**:
   - Update Scanner UI with design tokens
   - Update Badge UI (Tailwind config)
   - Update Form UI (Vuetify theme)

5. **Test Everything**:
   - Registration flow (form → database)
   - Badge generation (database → badge)
   - QR scanning (badge → scanner)
   - Database viewing (Adminer)

### Nice to Have

6. **Add Authentication**: Protect admin endpoints
7. **Setup Monitoring**: Add logging and metrics
8. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automate testing and deployment
9. **Production Config**: Environment-specific settings

## 🐛 Known Issues

1. **Form service** still on Deno (needs Bun migration)
2. **UI inconsistency** across services (design system not yet applied)
3. **No authentication** on any endpoints
4. **Limited error handling** in some APIs

## 💡 Tips

- **Database Location**: `./data/gotalent.db` on your host machine
- **Backups**: Copy `data/gotalent.db` regularly
- **Logs**: Use `docker-compose logs -f <service>` to debug
- **Development**: Run services individually for faster iteration
- **Production**: Use Caddy's HTTPS with real domain

## 📚 Documentation

Detailed documentation available in:

- `README.md` - Complete project documentation
- `MIGRATION_PLAN.md` - Technical migration details
- `MIGRATION_SUMMARY.md` - What was changed
- `landing/README.md` - Landing page specifics

## ✨ Benefits of New Architecture

✅ **Single Database**: No more data synchronization issues  
✅ **Faster Runtime**: Bun is 2-3x faster than Node.js  
✅ **Easy Deployment**: One Docker Compose command  
✅ **Unified Design**: Consistent user experience  
✅ **Better Routing**: Caddy handles all proxying  
✅ **Easy Database Management**: Adminer built-in  
✅ **Modern Stack**: Latest tools and best practices  

## 🎯 Success Checklist

Use this to verify your setup:

- [ ] All services start with `docker-compose up`
- [ ] Landing page loads at `http://localhost`
- [ ] Form accessible at `http://localhost/form`
- [ ] Badge accessible at `http://localhost/badge`
- [ ] Scanner accessible at `http://localhost/scanner`
- [ ] Adminer accessible at `http://localhost/db`
- [ ] Database file exists at `./data/gotalent.db`
- [ ] All services can read/write to database
- [ ] Health endpoints return 200 OK
- [ ] Old data migrated successfully

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**Services won't start?**
```bash
docker-compose down
docker-compose up --build
```

**Database errors?**
```bash
# Check database exists
ls -la data/

# Re-run migration
bun run migrate-db.js
```

**Port conflicts?**
```bash
# Check what's using ports
lsof -i :3001 -i :3002 -i :3003 -i :3004 -i :8080

# Kill conflicting processes or change ports in compose.yml
```

**Caddy not routing?**
```bash
# Check Caddy logs
docker-compose logs caddy

# Verify Caddyfile syntax
docker-compose exec caddy caddy validate --config /etc/caddy/Caddyfile
```
